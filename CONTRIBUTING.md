## Reporting Bugs

When reporting an issue, you should always report one issue per bug. If you notice several
bugs and want to report them, please make **individual issues for all of them**.

Issues are often reported several times, please make sure that your issue already exists
before you report them, search them first [here](https://github.com/EyeDaleHim/Crow-Engine/issues)

If you don't find a relevant match or if you're unsure, do not hesitate to **open a new issue**.

## Pull Requests

If you want to contribute to the engine, make sure that:

- The functionality is desired, which means that it solves a common use case that several users
will need in their projects.
- Make sure that the contribution does not affect performance majorly. You can ignore this rule if
your pull request does not alter the code in any way.
- Even if it doesn't get merged, your PR is useful for future work by another developer.
- Document every change, if your pull requests add methods that others may not understand in a way,
please add a comment shortly explaining them.
- If the PR is made to resolve a change, please link the original issue.

Do not hesitate to explain your reasoning for your PR in a verbose or quick way, as long as you go with
readability in mind.

## Code Style

Code Style is a necessity in code, not because to look fancier or cooler but this will ensure others
understand what you're trying to do with your code.

To maintain code style, make sure:

- Your variable name makes sense, do not name variables like `poopface` and `gjhyredru`, please make sure that
your variable names are related to the PR.
